     "algorithm": "This algorithm refines the initial design idea by selecting the next node that minimizes a specific score, calculated as a ratio. The score prioritizes visiting closer nodes (greedy distance in the numerator) but strongly favors those that are also remote from both the final destination and the remaining cluster of unvisited nodes (a combined \"look-ahead\" factor in the denominator). By minimizing this ratio, the heuristic aims to efficiently visit \"outlier\" nodes that are conveniently nearby, addressing them early in the path construction.",
