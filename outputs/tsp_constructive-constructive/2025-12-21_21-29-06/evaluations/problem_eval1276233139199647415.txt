    Selects the next node to visit using a Two-Step Minimum Cost heuristic.
    This heuristic considers the immediate distance to a candidate node and
    then estimates the best possible next step from that candidate node
    (either to another unvisited node or directly to the destination).

    Args:
        current_node: The node currently at.
        destination_node: The starting node of the tour, to which the path must return.
        unvisited_nodes: A set of nodes that have not yet been visited.
        distance_matrix: A 2D list (matrix) where distance_matrix[i][j]
                         is the distance between node i and node j.

    Returns:
        The next node to visit.
