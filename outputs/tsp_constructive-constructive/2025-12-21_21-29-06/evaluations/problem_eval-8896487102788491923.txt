    Selects the next node to visit using a greedy heuristic with consideration for the return path to the destination.
    This heuristic minimizes the sum of the immediate distance to a candidate node and
    the distance from that candidate node directly back to the tour's starting destination.

    Args:
        current_node: The node currently at.
        destination_node: The starting node of the tour, to which the path must return.

                         is the distance between node i and node j.

    Returns:
        The next node to visit.
