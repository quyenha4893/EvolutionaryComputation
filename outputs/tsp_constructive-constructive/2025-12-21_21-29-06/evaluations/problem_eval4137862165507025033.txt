    Selects the next node to visit based on a combined heuristic that considers
    immediate distance, a look-ahead to the next unvisited node, and the distance
    from the candidate node back to the destination.
    This version emphasizes the look-ahead more than the provided algorithm.

    Args:
        current_node: The node currently at.
        destination_node: The starting node of the tour, to which the path must return.
        unvisited_nodes: A set of nodes that have not yet been visited.

                         is the distance between node i and node j.

    Returns:
        The next node to visit.
