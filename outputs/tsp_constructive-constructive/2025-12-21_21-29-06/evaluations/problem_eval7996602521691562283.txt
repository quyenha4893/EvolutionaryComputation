    Selects the next node to visit by using a proportional weighting scheme (inspired by Algo 1)
    that prioritizes immediate distance (similar to Algo 2) but gives a slightly more
    pronounced, yet still subtle, influence to the distance from the candidate node back
    to the tour's starting point.

    Args:
        current_node: The node currently at.

                         is the distance between node i and node j.

    Returns:
        The next node to visit.
